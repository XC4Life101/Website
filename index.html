            Week 1: 8/21/23 - 8/25/23: <u><b>Marble ball run</b></u> 
            <br>
            The experiment went nicely. We struggled to catch the ball at first 
            because we were going to fast but we learned over time that speed isn't
            everything. After we <br>manged the speed of the ball we realised that we
            needed people to hand off the pipe in front of the person because doing
            it from behind messed up the rythym <br> and confused the group as a whole.
            Then, after much trial and error, we got the marble to the bucket, but
            were unable to land it in the bucket. To fix this we <br>started the line
            lower and rolled it slower so there was no room for error. However, we
            ran out of time and were unable to complete the assigment.<br>

            Week 2: 8/28/23 - 9/1/23: <u><b>Mechanical Engineering</b></u> 
            <br>
            We learned about the engineering process and the discipline of Mechanical
            Engineering. The process includes: Ask, Research, Imagine, Plan,
            Create, Test, <br> Improve and back again. Engineers will not always go in
            order and may jump around in the process many times. We also learned about
            simple machines of <br> mechanical engineering such as the inclined plane, wedge,
            screw, lever, pulley and the wheel-and-axle. We are currently working
            on a rube goldberg machine <br> in tinkercad which is a machine that has a complicated
            process to do a simple task.

            Week 3: 9/5/23 - 9/8/23: <u><b>Tinkercad of Rube Goldberg Machine</b></u> 
            <br>
            We learned how to use tinkercad and made a rube goldberg machine with it.
            Our machine starts with a ramp, makes two turns, and goes over a lever
            to ride a <br> car with a needle into a balloon causing it to pop. We had
            trouble with the turns and getting it all to scale. We now started building
            it in real life and have <br> completed the ramp. Dominic is our material manager
            and makes sure our materials don't get lost and are all accounted for.

            Week 4: 9/11/23 - 9/14/23: <u><b>Building Rube Goldberg Machine</b></u> 
            <br>
            This week we worked on perfecting our Rube Goldberg machine in an effort 
            to cause a baseball to ultimatly pop a balloon. It was working great at
            first as we <br> all worked effectivly and divied up the work so that it all 
            came together by the last day. Unfortunately we did not anticipate the
            aiming of the ball into the car, <br> and ended up changing a lot to account 
            for this miscalculation. By the end, we had a baseball roll down a ramp,
            make two turns, go over a seasaw, bump into <br> a car with a needle attached,
            and finish off by popping a balloon. We had our ups and downs but the
            experience helped me learn to work better with others and <br>respect their 
            opinions.

            Week 5: 9/18/23 - 9/21/23: <u><b>Boats and "E" Challenge as well as Computer Engineering</b></u> 
            <br>
           This week we focused on the different routes of Computer Engineering as well
           as what it encompasses and utilizes. We also completed various challenges <br>
           like the boat-building challenge that tasks us with making a flotation device to carry
           a specified ammount for 5 minutes, and designing the measurements and<br> dimensions
           of a letter 'E' for someone to cut out and create. This tests our attention to detail
           as well as how well we could execute directions. The boat-building<br> challenge
           helped us to think critically about much weight we should attempt to hold and
           showed us the difference in approaches that we could take. Overall, my<br> boat ended
           up failign because I was too ambitious with the weight that I carried, and my E
           was flawless because I had great attention to detail and left nothing out.

            <br>
           This week we learned more about Computer Engineering and what the different
           parts of a computer encompass. The computer has 6 essential parts: the CPU, <br>
           Motherboard, GPU, RAM, Storage, and Peripherals. We also learned of Moore's 
           Law which states that every two years, the number of transistors doubles in<br>
           an area. This is how computers get smaller and more advanced so quickly. We
           also took apart a computer and put it back together to test if we followed <br>
           instructions. Our computer was missing the storage and RAM so we didn't know
           if we did it right.

           This week we learned about Bio-Engineering and how broad it was. It 
           encompasses a great many other engineering types like electrical, 
           chemical, and Computer <br>depending on the job you go into. We also talked 
           about a branch of bio-engineering known as biomimicry where engineers 
           attempt to replicate parts of nature in<br> their inventions. We also built 
           a functioning prosthetic arm that ould grab and pick up an empty water 
           bottle. We also, still focusing on prosthetics, made a tinkercad <br>of a 
           prosthetic for an injured animal. I made mine a turtle for a shell, but
           I forgot to add holes for the arms and legs so it didn't turn out how I 
           wanted.

            <br>
            This week we learned about Aerospace Engineering and it's division into
            Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. We developed a Tinkercad
            of a rocket or <br>airplane to use as the design for our bottle rockets 
            that we would make next week. Mine was an airplane with two sets of 
            wings: Large rectangular wings near the<br> nose of the plane and smaller 
            square wings near the thrust. It had a round nose to divert the air 
            around it and ridges on the top to alleviate drag. I didn't put into<br> 
            consideration the bottle that it would attach to so it ended up not 
            being made to scale.

           This week we continued to learn about Aerospace Engineering, but more
           importantly, we began engineering our Tinkercad design into a real-life
           rocket! Out of<br> the designs that me and my partner came up with, we decided
           to comnbine ours and add a little bit from both designs. We made many
           mistakes such as gluing the<br> wing on backwards, not cutting the wing flaps
           in the right angle, and not keeping track of the time we had to make it.
           In the end, we had to come back at lunch<br> and finish, but the result was
           something to be proud of. When we launched it, it was with 85 PSI and had
           a cup of water put into it. It was aimed high and once<br> launched, it did a 
           loopty loop spin and ended up being the 6th farthest flying bottle!

            <br>
            This week we learned about Environmental Engineering and the different
            fields it is implemented in. Environmental Engineers work to build 
            machines that<br> clean the air, protect the land, and provide clean water 
            to those who don't have it. I participated in a water filtration challenge 
            that encompassed a bottle as our<br> filter and various cleansing materials.
            I used cottonballs on the bottom, than sand to cover it up, than smaller rocks
            and finally large rocks to catch any larger<br> debree. We did it in order of
            large on top and small on the bottom so that the filtration was gradual. 
            Ours wasn't anything special and turned out like the rest. <br>It turned
            the water from dark brown to a light yellow, but no matter how many times
            we ran it through the filter it remained yellow.

            <br>
            This week we learned about electrical engineering and how circuits and how
            electricity functions. We practiced formulas to solve for Voltage, Current,
            and Resistance <br>using Ohm's law. We also developed and created circuit 
            boards using Tinkercad that used a breadboard with LED's as Diodes, 
            resistors, and a 5V disk. We <br>created two, one in parrellel and one in series.
            I had trouble understanding how it all connected but by Friday I understood
            how to make the light turn on.

            We continued with the Circuit building Lab from last week and had quite
            a bit of trouble. I was practically soloing the project because my 
            partner was <br>distracted and unwilling to partake in the lab. I struggled
            to figure out how the circuits fit togther at first, but eventually 
            caught on. Due to my phone not having <br> a screen protector or case, I 
            could not bring it to school, which did not allow me to take pictures 
            of my finished circuits. Overall, I realized that<br> circuits are very 
            particular, and that it must be done in a very certain way.

            We finished lab 4 for electrical engineering and created circuitry that
            had up to 4 LED's blinking in a synchronised pattern. It was difficult
            to get the first part of <br>the lab working, but after that it was just 
            plug-and-play with the code. We then moved on to Business engineering
            which mixes the engineering process and the<br> financial side of inventing
            to make a profit out of the inventions made. We implemented that by 
            brainstorming shark tank pitches which did not go well. We <br>struggled
            to find a problem that could be fixed and thinking up something that 
            had not already been made.

            This week we worked on our Shark Tank pitches. We had trouble figuring
            out what to do as we couldn't think of any problem that hadn't already
            been solved or at least <br>attempted. Plus, two of our partners did nothing
            so we had to solo the brainstorming. We eventually thought up Recyrcles, 
            a meal replacement for those who can't afford<br> food, using thrown away
            food. My favorite pitch that I heard was the Thermo-spoon, a lot of 
            the ideas I heard of already and didn't really need but the thermo
            spoon is<br> something I would actually buy.

                <li>The total water weight that was held by the bridge worked on by Dominic was 1241 grams. The total water weight held by the bridge worked on by me and Naz held 675 grams.</li>
                <li>For our bridge that weighed 57.4g it could carry 11.8g of water for every gram of weight. The bridge that was 46.7g could carry 26.6g of water per 1 gram of weight.</li>

                    *For the following questions I will refer to the bridge I worked on that weighed 57.4 grams.

                    <br>
                <li>The parts that contributed to the bulk of the weight in our bridge were the two points near the center where we trippled the layering of the pasta. 
                <br>This was in order to sustain the weight of the string tied on from the bucket.</li>
                <li>The inspiration for the design of our bridge came from imagination. I wanted it to be different so I attempted to see if quantity over quality could get the job done.</li>
                <li>The design did not work as intended and lacked the support and layering to sustain itself. Who knew that having arches would actually further support a bridge?</li>
                <li>The point of failure in our bridge was its lack of horizontal support and the lack of thickness and its streamlined design. 
                <br>By changing even one of these we could have avoided a break and added another cup of water to our weight.</li>
                <li>A major way to imporve and fix our bridge would have been to add arches or some form of vertical support. Another thing would have been to cross the spagetthi to prolong breaking.</li>

            chose to build <br>the arduino car, and because neither of us had done it 
            before, we had a lot to research. I looked into the code for Arduino

            This week me and my partner started to design the car. We made a rough
            sketch first and decided, because we were only provided with 2 wheels,
            that we would <br>make a 2 wheel car, with a really small wheel on the back.
            We made a tinkercad of the design an had a lot of extra time so we
            addedd a bumper that said<br> "Don't be a drag" becuase the smaller wheel 
            would make it drag along the floor. We than were given the materials 
            and began the code to make the wheels<br> start spinning. We had a lot of
            trouble so it hasn't responded to our code.

            setup given to us<br> to respond but as we researched further we found a 
            wire configuration that allowed us to control our car. Later in the week
            we sautered wires to our wheels<br> to allow us to connect them to our 
            arduino recieved a 9V battery for a more reliable power source. Becuase 
            the wire setupa and code that we used did not<br> account for thus, we had
            to doover our wire setup and find new working code.

            in the beggining becuase <br>are code would not run and our wheels would not spin.
            We thought that the reason could be various things, Wiring issues, a 
            dead battery, a error in our code,<br> but to no avail we could not figure it
            out. We went to Mr. Poole's room where he told us the mistake. It was
            because we had faulty sautering which caused <br>the circuit to incorrectly
            fused. Once we fixed it we were able to code the wheels to go backwards
            and forwards at various speeds and time intervals by<br> building functions
            to control various actions the car would make.

            to do the brunt work. He successfully built the body of the car and 
            managed to get all<br> the pieces in the right place, unfortunately he 
            also allowed the car to fall on the floor multiple times causing the
            wiring to be re-sautered and the body to<br> be rebuilt. We were than able
            to add some last-minute coding adjustments to control the movement of
            the car without issue. Next week, we'll be able to apply <br>the sensor 
            and hopefully allow it to move on its own without human intervention.

            Week 7: 02/19/24 - 02/23/24: <u><b>Testing Day</b></u> 
            <br>
            Testing went great! We were a little rushed for time from me being 
            gone all of last week, but we got through in the end. We gave up on 
            trying to code a sensor <br> and stuck to a preset algorithm that we would
            loop for testing. The idea was for our car to move forward, stop, turn,
            move forward, stop, turn, until it had made<br> a square, than to spin really 
            fast in a circle, than to jerk forward and backward left and right 
            rhythmically. Most of our endeavors held through like the square<br> and 
            circle codes, but the jerking motion we anticipated would not run due
            to poor friction on the wheels. If there was anything I could change 
            about our car it <br>would be the way we glued our cd to the back of it, 
            allowing it to slide instead of rub frictionally against the floor.

            Week 8: 02/26/24 - 03/01/24: <u><b>Egg project + Doors Vs. Winodows Challenge</b></u> 
            <br>
            This week we researched the design for our egg driop challenge and 
            had many ideas, we thought about adding balloons fro cushioning and 
            a trash bag as a parachute. <br>With all these ideas we decided to use all
            of them in one big extravaganza in hopes that if one failed, the others 
            would cover for it. We finished building the box <br>for our egg and attached 
            strings which would connect it to the parachute. Next week, we plan 
            on adding the parachute and the popsicles that protect it from direct <br>
            damgage to the egg. We also went around the school for a challenge to 
            prove that there are more wheels than doors on campus. We defined a 
            wheel as a circle that <br>roates which includes: locks, fans, and ofcourse
            your standard wheel of a chair or car.

            Week 9: 03/04/24 - 03/08/24: <u><b>Egg project + Paper Throw</b></u> 
            <br>
            This week we continued the finishing touches on our egg drop design, 
            and we did a challenge relating to how far you can throw paper. For 
            the egg-drop, we added<br> the trash bag as a parachute, cutting it to
            make it less elongated and have a wider surface area. We also attached
            popsicle sticks to the sides to delay the impact<br> from the fall. Lastly, 
            we added to balloons to the bottom to cushion the landing without risk
            of cracking. For the paper throw challenge,I made a paper airplane<br> that
            was an extremly close 4th! It was at most a foot away from the other 
            competitors and would have won if I only threw it slightly harder.

            Week 10: 03/11/24 - 03/15/24: <u><b>Egg Drop and Water Balloon</b></u> 
            <br>
            Our egg drop had a rocky start. While we were hurrying to finish the 
            final touches on our design, the tape that had held everything together 
            was falling<br> off. We had to wuickly apply new tape and though it was stil
            popping open on some of it's corners, we just had to make due with what
            had. When it <br>dropped, it fell with a loud thud and we thought we were
            doomed. After checking on it however, the egg was without a scratch and 
            completely fine. <br>The cotton balls were thw main reason for our success 
            as they provdided cushioning in a tight packed box allowing the egg to 
            be fastened in place.<br> For the water balloon challenge, it went rather well
            at first we struggled to think of a design and eventually hastily made
            a clamping mechanism to <br>hold the balloon in place. Because it was not 
            super reliable I was unable to go at my top speed which gave us a lower 
            placement in the race then we<br> hoped.

            Week 11: 03/26/24 - 03/29/24: <u><b></b></u> 
            <br>
            Our project for this week was to make a flotation device that could 
            go through an 8 centimeter wide gutter, the fastest. We decided to 
            design a dual-sailed sail boat<br> that was streamlined and would be light
            enough for the wind to carry. Because our materials were limited we 
            decided to go for a platsic cup base and use popsicle<br> sticks for the 
            masts. We would then use construiction paper to catch the wind or tissue
            paper depending on which material worked better. The one problem with 
            it<br> was that it was very wobbly and might topple over if we were not 
            careful.

            Week 12: 04/01/24 - 04/05/24: <u><b></b></u> 
            <br>
            We finished our boat and realised that it was a failure for the project.
            It didn't even last a second in the practice test becuase it always 
            tipped over. We scratched <br>both sails and added a sail to the middle 
            without a mast going straight up and instead had it go diagonalley. 
            With this one simple change our boat zoomed threw<br> the gutter from the
            wind and whenever the wind died or it got stuck, you could just blow
            it the rest of the way! It was a major success and speedily went to
            the <br>end.
